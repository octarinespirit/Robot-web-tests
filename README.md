Folders: 
keywords - for user key-words
resource - for locators
results - tests result files go here
tests - Folders: API, Connectivity, Security, Special, UI
webdriver - Chrome and Firefox webdrivers

Currently implemented are UI tests for menu links, and also
a special test case with user-keyword created with python to 
scrape the texts of a blog entry and save them to a text file.

URL address is asked from the user when starting to run the tests,
so it's not publicly hardcoded here to the files.
